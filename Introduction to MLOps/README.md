# Introduction to MLOps  

MLOps is the combination of **Machine Learning**, **Software Engineering**, and **Operations**. It ensures ML systems are production-ready by following coding standards, managing data, automating pipelines, and enabling scalability and monitoring.  

> "A good ML engineer should meet the coding standards of a software engineer and understand operations."

## Prerequisites  

- **Python Basics**: Understand Python, IDEs like VS Code, and Virtual Environments.  
- **ML Knowledge**: Hands-on experience with ML projects like House Price Prediction or Customer Churn Prediction.  
- **Accounts on Platforms**: GitHub, AWS, GCP, or Azure.

## Data Science Project Lifecycle (Before MLOps)  

1. **Understand the Problem**: Define the use case and plan a solution.  
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean the data.  
3. **EDA**: Analyze data to identify patterns.  
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features from raw data.  
5. **Feature Selection**: Retain only useful features for efficient training.  
6. **Model Training**: Train the model based on data insights.  
7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model parameters.  
8. **Model Evaluation**: Measure model performance.  
9. **App Building**: Create a user-friendly interface.  
10. **Deployment**: Deploy the model for real-world use.

## Problems with Traditional Data Science Practice  

1. **Low Coding Standards**:  
   - Lack of modularity and error handling.  
   - No use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  

2. **Data Management Issues**:  
   - Real-world data is often large, distributed, or real-time (e.g., from databases or APIs).  

3. **No Versioning**:  
   - Need version control for data and models (e.g., using DVC or MLflow).  
   - Rollback models if performance degrades.  

4. **No Automated Pipelines**:  
   - Manual execution of data preprocessing, training, and evaluation is inefficient.  
   - Pipelines automate these steps, saving time.  

5. **Lack of Experimentation Management**:  
   - Experiment with different techniques systematically (e.g., testing alternative models).  

6. **No CI/CD**:  
   - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment ensures changes to any step don’t break the system.  

7. **Scalability and Monitoring**:  
   - Handle increased traffic (e.g., from 10 users/day to 1000 users/day).  
   - Monitor for consistent performance over time.  

8. **Cross-Team Dependency**:  
   - Understand enough about **data engineering** and **operations** to work independently.

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)  

In traditional software development:  

1. **Development**: Writing and testing code.  
2. **Delivery**: Containerizing applications (e.g., with Docker).  
3. **Deployment**: Running the application on a server.  
4. **Maintenance**: Ensuring it works post-production.  

When developers and operations teams work together, it’s called **DevOps**. Similarly, MLOps brings together Data Science, Engineering, and Operations.

### Why MLOps?  

If you were hiring, would you prefer:  
1. A data scientist who builds models OR  
2. A professional who combines **Data Science**, **Software Engineering**, and **Operations**?  

The second one is the future of ML!
