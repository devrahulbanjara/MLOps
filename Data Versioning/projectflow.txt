inside a local repo, create code.py and code to it, it will save a csv file to a new data folder
add commit push
till now we have nothing without dvc
now pip install dvc
dvc init , creates .dvcignore and .dvc
create a new folder named S3
dvc remote add -d myremote S3
dvc add data/    , since data folder has the csv file here
it will throw error since git is already tracking it, we must ask git to untrack this folder data
git rm -r --cached 'data'
git commit -m "stop tracking data" 
again do dvc add data, added successfully
the above code to remove has added the data/ folder to gitignore so that it doesnt track anymore
