#I have created a new file and then added this line due to which 
#doing git status will show me that there is a new file which is untracked

#now if we do git add first.py, then it gets added to the staging area, meaning that it will get tracked now.
#after adding this line to the file, we can do git status and it will show that the file has been modified, now it is no more untracked.
